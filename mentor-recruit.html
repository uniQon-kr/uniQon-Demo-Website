        <p class="smallBody">Remember when you were preparing for college? The times you crumpled up half-  
        </br>written admissions essays, pored over exams for a good GPA, stayed behind school
        </br>hours to do club activities?</p>
        <p class="smallBody">Those days are probably now behind you, having done their intended part by getting
        </br>you where you are, but they can do so much more.</p>
        <p class="smallBody">We provide the link between your data - your essays, GPA, and activities - and the
        </br>mentees in need of them, who use the data to move forward in their own goals and
        </br>dreams, much like you did.</p>
        <p class="smallBody">Help pave the way for them.</p>
