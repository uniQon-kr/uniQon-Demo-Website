**Terms of Service - Mentors
Last update: Sep. 20. 2020**

Before you start reading, please bear in mind that we may send mentees your way for tutoring based on your profile.

**1.** **Credit Policy**
1 credit is the equivalent of 1 Korean Won (₩). The credits you will initially receive upon successfully submitting your full profile (not the basic one!) and the credits you will receive when someone unlocks your profile are as follows:

Tier A Universities: 100,000KRW (pre-tax) upon initial submission, 50,000KRW (pre-tax) per sale

- Columbia University (NY)
- Harvard University (MA)
- Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MA)
- Princeton University (NJ)
- Stanford University (CA)
- University of Chicago (IL)
- University of Pennsylvania (Wharton) (PA)
- Yale University (CT)

Tier B Universities: 75,000 KRW (pre-tax) upon initial submission, 37,500 KRW (pre-tax) per sale

- Amherst College (MA)
- Brown University (RI)
- California Institute of Technology (CA)
- Cornell University (NY)
- Dartmouth College (NH)

- Northwestern University (IL)
- University of California, Berkeley (CA)
- University of Pennsylvania (non-Wharton) (PA)
- Vanderbilt University (TN)
- Washington University in St. Louis (MO)
- Williams College (MA)

Your credits will be visible to you (and only you) at all times on your profile page.

**2. Cash-out Policy**
You will be able to cash out your credits once your uniQon account reaches 200,000 credits. The minimum amount of credits you can cash out is 200,000. This means if you have 300,000 credits and you choose to cash out 200,000 of them, you will have to wait until you gain another 100,000 credits to cash out the rest.

**3. Taxation**
Under Korean law, the payment you receive for uploading your data to our site is classified as “taxable other incomes,” or “과세 대상 기타소득.” This means the money you will receive upon cashing out your credits will be post-tax (8.8%).

**4. Period of Service**
The initial period of service, during which we will keep your profile on our page, is one year; you will be asked if you want to continue using our services once that year is up. Should you wish for us to switch your status to “non-active” (no one will be able to unlock your profile, but part of your profile will still be searchable on our page), please give us at least two months’ prior notice via email. If a mentor’s page stays at “non-active” status for six consecutive months, we take their profile down entirely, but we will retain the information necessary for us to deal with possible customer claims for a period of three years maximum. Please refer to the long version of our Privacy Policy for the specifics.

**5. Call for Supplementary Information**
Mentors may be asked for add some information to your profile after you first submit it to us via the forms provided - you will have a deadline of three working days to respond. If the process of submission does not end after 30 days, you will be given a choice between annulling the entire process and reapplying; for the latter, you will have to fill in the forms again. Please note that failure to respond to an enquiry within three days will automatically result in us deleting all your data.

**6. How the System Works**
Step one, you fill this form out. Step two, we go through it (you'll be able to double-check as well). Step three, we send you the final form via email. Step four, you fill the final form out and we upload it to our page. Note that in some cases there might be a step four-point-five; we might ask you for more information, or further details regarding the information already given, so don't write down anything you can't prove.

Once your final profile is uploaded to our page, mentees will be able to look through and pick mentors whose profiles they'd like to examine in greater detail. Our team at uniQon will be doing it too, since mentees can also choose to ask us to pick mentors best suited to their situation. If your profile is chosen, you will receive an incentive depending on your tier.

After your profile is chosen, you may be contacted to set up a sample tutoring session. The sample session will be conducted via video; it will last around twenty minutes, during which you can briefly explain to the parent and the mentee how you will be tutoring them. After that, we inform you if you are chosen for the tutoring (decision to be reached within 48 hours of the sample session). If you are, we can start discussing hours.

A single class lasts 60 minutes, and you will be paid 120,000KRW/hour pre-tax for essays and 60,000KRW/hour pre-tax for others, like activities and academics. You'll need to consult with us and the student on how many hours you'll need to put in for tutoring. We do have a guideline for how much time each project takes, for you to take note of if necessary.

Communication between you and your mentee will mostly be handled by us. Apart from the tutoring itself, you will not have to concern yourself about other issues that may arise (although if you are the cause of the problem - for example if you don't show up in time for class - that's another matter entirely)
